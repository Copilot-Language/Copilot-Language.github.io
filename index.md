## Introduction
Copilot is a runtime verification framework written in Haskell. It allows the
user to write programs in a simple but powerful way using a stream-based
approach.

Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
for systems with hard realtime requirements.


## Installation

Currently the Copilot 3.0 release requires GHC 8.0 or higher.

Copilot is available from
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot), and the latest version
can be installed easily:

    cabal install copilot

Alternatively one can download and install it from the repositories as well:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot.git
    cd Copilot
    git submodule update --init --remote
    make

Typically one would only go this route to develop Copilot. For regular users
the cabal method is highly recommended.


## Example
Here follows a simple example of a heating system. Other examples can be found
in the [Examples
directory](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/tree/master/Examples)
of the main repository.

    -- This is a simple example with basic usage. It implements a simple home
    -- heating system: It heats when temp gets too low, and stops when it is high
    -- enough. It read temperature as a byte (range -50C to 100C) and translates
    -- this to Celcius.

    module Heater where

    import Language.Copilot
    import Copilot.Compile.C99

    import Prelude hiding ((>), (<), div)

    -- External temperature as a byte, range of -50C to 100C
    temp :: Stream Word8
    temp = extern "temperature" Nothing

    -- Calculate temperature in Celcius.
    -- We need to cast the Word8 to a Float. Note that it is an unsafeCast, as there
    -- is no direct relation between Word8 and Float.
    ctemp :: Stream Float
    ctemp = (unsafeCast temp) * (150.0 / 255.0) - 50.0

    spec = do
      -- Triggers that fire when the ctemp is too low or too high,
      -- pass the current ctemp as an argument.
      trigger "heaton"  (ctemp < 18.0) [arg ctemp]
      trigger "heatoff" (ctemp > 21.0) [arg ctemp]

    -- Compile the spec
    main = reify spec >>= compile "heater"


## Documentation
A manual to Copilot can be downloaded [here](copilot_tutorial.pdf).

Copilot comes with a set of examples as part of its distribution, available in
the [Examples
directory](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/tree/master/Examples) of
the main repository.


## Structure and Sources
Apart from the Copilot [Github project
page](https://github.com/Copilot-Language), there are a number of sub-projects
that make up Copilot:

- `Copilot`: The main Copilot package, to which all others are a dependency.
  One should install this one to install Copilot.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot))

- `copilot-core`: The core language, which efficiently represents Copilot
  expressions. The core is only of interest to implementers wishing to add a
  new back-end to Copilot.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-core))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-core))

- `copilot-language`: The front-end of Copilot defining the user language. A
  user of Copilot typically interacts with this library.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-language))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-language))

- `copilot-libraries`: User-supplied libraries for Copilot, including
  linear-temporal logic, fault-tolerant voting, regular expressions, etc.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-libraries))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-libraries))

- `copilot-c99`: A backend writing hard realtime C99 code. It writes
  readable output and ensures the output code is constant in memory and time.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-c99))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-c99))

- `copilot-theorem`: Some tools to prove properties on Copilot.
  ([Sources](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-theorem))
  ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-theorem))

Additionally there is a specific repository that lists most of the papers and
articles written on Copilot:
[copilot-discussion](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-discussion).
