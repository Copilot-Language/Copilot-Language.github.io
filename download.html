				<h1>Download &amp; Installing</h1>

<p>Copilot is implemented as a Embedded Domain Specific Language in Haskell.
Currently Copilot 3.14 requires a version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
of at least 8.6 to be installed. The recommended way to do this is by
installing the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. The
Haskell platform comes with the compiler and basic tools necessary to install
Copilot.</p>

<p>With a newly installed Haskell environment, we can easily install the latest
version of Copilot. As a regular user, just execute the following two commands
from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>cabal update
cabal install copilot
</code></pre>

<p>These commands first update the list of known packages, and secondly install
the latest available version of Copilot and all of its dependencies.</p>

<p>After these commands successfully finish, Copilot is installed and ready to
use.</p>
