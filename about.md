# About
Copilot is a realtime programming language and Runtime Verification framework.
It allows users to write concise programs in a simple but powerful way using a
stream-based approach.

Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99 backend
ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time, making it suitable
for systems with hard realtime requirements. Copilot provides a strong type
system that helps keeping programmers from making common mistakes, aiding in
the quality of the code.

Copilot provides a library providing higher-level constructs, for example for
defining clocks, a Boyer-Moore majority voting implementation and various
temporal logics, including Linear Temporal logic (LTL) and Past Time LTL.
