						Copilot is a realtime programming language and Runtime Verification
						framework.  It allows users to write concise programs in a simple
						but powerful way using a stream-based approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						Programs can be interpreted for testing, or translated C99 code to be
						incorporated in a project, or as a standalone application. The C99
						backend ensures us that the output is constant in memory and time,
						making it suitable for systems with hard realtime requirements.

				<h2>News</h2>

<p><strong>Release 3.14 – 2023-03-07</strong></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.14, a stream-based DSL
for writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness
and hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level
runtime verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and
MTL), clocks and voting algorithms.</p>

<p>Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems
Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of
drones.</p>

<p>This release removes deprecated definitions, provides support for
GHC 9.4 and What4 1.4, and includes a much improved README. The new release has
been published on hackage, as well as github.</p>

<p>This release also continues to use our new software engineering process
designed to meet the requirements to obtain NASA’s Class D software
classification. Details are available <a
href="https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot/milestone/17?closed=1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Current emphasis is on improving the codebase in terms of stability and test
coverage, removing unnecessary dependencies, hiding internal definitions, and
formatting the code to meet our new coding standards. Users are encouraged to
participate by opening issues and asking questions via our <a
href="https://github.com/copilot-language/copilot">github repo</a>.</p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>Copilot is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause licence, which can be found
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/master/LICENSE">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>We are grateful for NASA Contract NNL08AD13T to Galois, Inc. and the National
Institute of Aerospace, which partially supported this work.</p>

<p>Additionally NASA Langley contracts 80LARC17C0004 and NNL09AA00A supported
further development of Copilot.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Kaveh Darafsheh (NASA Langley Research Center) for his
help with testing Copilot. In addition numerous people have helped with smaller
things, reporting bugs etc. Thanks to all of them!</p>
