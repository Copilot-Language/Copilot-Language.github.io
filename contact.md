# Contact & Help
Having trouble using Copilot, or encountered a possible bug? Asking questions
or reporting bugs can both be done through the issue tracker at GitHub. This
helps us keep track of open bugs and problems, and allows us to easily comment
and discuss the issue.

As Copilot consists of several packages, each of them comes with its own issue
tracker. If you have a question about a specific package or encountered a
problem specific to a package, please report the problem at that package, if
possible. In all other cases, please refer to the issue tracker of the general
Copilot package:

* [copilot](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/Copilot/issues) (General issues)
* [copilot-core](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-core/issues)
* [copilot-language](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-language/issues)
* [copilot-libraries](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-libraries/issues)
  (Issues with any of the functions defined in the library)
* [copilot-c99](https://github.com/Copilot-Language/copilot-c99/issues) (Issues
  with generating C code)
