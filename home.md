**Release 3.6 -- 2021-11-07**

We are pleased to announce the release of Copilot 3.6, a stream-based DSL for
writing and monitoring embedded C programs, with an emphasis on correctness and
hard realtime requirements. Copilot is typically used as a high-level runtime
verification framework, and supports temporal logic (LTL, PTLTL and MTL),
clocks and voting algorithms.

Among others, Copilot has been used at the Safety Critical Avionics Systems
Branch of NASA Langley Research Center for monitoring test flights of drones.

This new release supports three new operators: atan2, floor, and ceiling.
Additionally, the target directory of the code generated by Copilot can now be
customized. Release 3.6 also includes a battery of unit tests for the library
copilot-core. This release introduces other fixes in the code and in the
documentation, and deprecates definitions that have been superseded or that
were largely unused.

Current emphasis is on facilitating the use with other systems, and improving
the codebase in terms of stability and test coverage. Users are encouraged to
participate by opening issues and asking questions via our [github
repo](https://github.com/copilot-language/copilot).
